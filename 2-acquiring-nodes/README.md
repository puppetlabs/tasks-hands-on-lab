# Setting up test nodes to use with Bolt

> **Difficulty**: Basic

> **Time**: Approximately 5 minutes

In this exercise you will create nodes that you can use to experiment with Bolt. You can also use existing nodes in your system if you prefer. 

- [Existing nodes](#existing-nodes)
- [Using Vagrant](#using-vagrant)
- [Using Docker](#using-docker)

# Prerequisites
To use an attached configuration file to set up test nodes, you must have one of the following installed on your machine: 

- [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) 
- [Docker for Mac](https://www.docker.com/docker-mac) 
- [Docker for Windows](https://www.docker.com/docker-windows) 

# Existing nodes

If you already have, or can easily launch, a few Linux or Windows nodes then you're all set. These nodes must be accessible via SSH or WinRM; if you can  access them via an SSH or WinRM client then Bolt can, too.

# Using Vagrant
**Note:** These instructions assume that you are familiar with Vagrant and have a suitable hypervisor configured.

The attached Vagrantfile configures three CentOS 7 nodes and a Windows (Nano Server) node.



1. Save the following code as `Vagrantfile` or download the `Vagrantfile` attached to this exercise. To configure a different number of nodes, change the `NODES` environment variable.


    ```ruby
    $nodes_count = 3
    
    if ENV['NODES'].to_i > 0 && ENV['NODES']
      $nodes_count = ENV['NODES'].to_i
    end
    
    Vagrant.configure('2') do |config|
      config.vm.box = 'centos/7'
      config.ssh.forward_agent = true
      config.vm.network "private_network", type: "dhcp"
    
      (1..$nodes_count).each do |i|
        config.vm.define "node#{i}"
      end
    
      config.vm.define :windows do |windows|
        windows.vm.box = "mwrock/WindowsNano"
        windows.vm.guest = :windows
        windows.vm.communicator = "winrm"
      end
    end
    ```
2. From the command line, ensure youâ€™re in the directory where you stored the Vagrantfile file and enter `vagrant up`.

3. Generate the SSH configuration so Bolt knows how to authenticate with the SSH daemon. The following command will output the required details.

    ```
    vagrant ssh-config
    ```
    
    You can save that so it will be automatically picked up by most SSH clients, including Bolt. This uses the ability to specify hosts along with their connection details in a [configuration file](https://linux.die.net/man/5/ssh_config).
    
    ```
    mkdir ~/.ssh
    vagrant ssh-config | sed /StrictHostKeyChecking/d | sed /UserKnownHostsFile/d >> ~/.ssh/config
    ```
    
    By saving this SSH configuration file, you can use the node name, rather than the IP address. When passing nodes to Bolt in the following exercises with Linux you will use `--nodes node1,node2`.

4. Make sure you can SSH into all of your nodes. If you've used the vagrant nodes before you may have to remove entries from `~/.ssh/known_hosts`.

```
ssh node1
ssh node2
ssh node3
```


# Using Docker
Using Docker we can quickly launch a number of ephemeral SSH servers. To make that even easier we'll use Docker Compose. 

1. Save the following code as `docker-compose.yml` or download the `docker-compose.yml` file attached to this exercise.

    ```yaml
    version: '3'
    services:
      ssh:
        image: rastasheep/ubuntu-sshd
        ports:
          - 22
    ```

2. Launch a single SSH server in the background: `docker-compose up --detach`. To launch more SSH servers, run:  `docker-compose up --scale ssh=3 --detach`.

3. View a list of running containers: `docker-compose ps`. The result should be similar to:  
    ```
            Name                 Command        State           Ports
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    2acquiringnodes_ssh_1   /usr/sbin/sshd -D   Up      0.0.0.0:32768->22/tcp
    2acquiringnodes_ssh_2   /usr/sbin/sshd -D   Up      0.0.0.0:32769->22/tcp
    ```
    
    Note the `Ports` column. We are forwarding a local port to the SSH server running in the container. Using the example above, you can SSH to `127.0.0.1:32768`.
    
4. If you have a local SSH client, test the connection. Change the port to one you get from running the `docker-compose ps` command. The image sets the username and password to `root`. 
    
    ```
    ssh root@127.0.0.1 -p 32768
    ```

5. Make sure you can log into all the nodes before moving on. You may have to remove some entries from `~/.ssh/known_hosts` 

    When passing nodes to Bolt in the next section you will use `--nodes 127.0.0.1:32768,127.0.0.1:32769`, replacing the ports with those you see when you run the `docker-compose ps` command.

# Next steps

Now that you have set up test nodes to use with Bolt you can move on to:
