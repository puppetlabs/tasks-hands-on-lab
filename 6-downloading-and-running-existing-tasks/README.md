# Running Existing Tasks

> **Difficulty**: Intermediate

> **Time**: Approximately 10 minutes

In this exercise you will explore some existing tasks, including several tasks that take advantage of Puppet under-the-hood.

> **Note:** Some of the following content will be available on The Forge soon.

- [Install Puppet using Bolt](#install-puppet-using-bolt)
- [Use package task to check status of package](#use-package-task-to-check-status-of-package)
- [Use package task to install a package](#use-package-task-to-install-a-package)
- [The Tasks Playground](#more-tips-tricks-and-ideas-on-the-tasks-playground)

# Prerequisites

For the following exercises you should already have `bolt` installed and have a few nodes (either Windows or Linux) available to run commands against. The following guides will help:

1. [Installing Bolt](../1-installing-bolt)
1. [Acquiring nodes](../2-acquiring-nodes)

It is also useful to have some familiarity with running commands with `bolt` so you understand passing nodes and credentials. The following exercise is recommended:

1. [Running Commands](../3-running-commands)

# Clone the control repo and configure Bolt's modulepath

These exercises will use the [task-modules](https://github.com/puppetlabs/task-modules) control repo. Like many control repos this repository contains some modules committed directly in the `site` directory and manages other with a `Puppetfile`.

```
mkdir ~/.puppetlabs
cd ~/.puppetlabs
git clone https://github.com/puppetlabs/task-modules.git
```

Now open `~/.puppetlabs/bolt.yml` and set up the bolt module path. The module path will include both modules commited directly in `site` and those managed by the puppetfile in `modules`.

```
---
modulepath: "~/.puppetlabs/task-modules/site:~/.puppetlabs/task-modules/modules"
# If you have to pass --insecure to skip host key verifaction you can
# uncomment these lines.
#ssh:
#  insecure: true
```

# Install Puppet using Bolt

The [`install_puppet` task](https://github.com/puppetlabs/task-modules/blob/master/site/install_puppet/tasks/init.sh) in task-modules contains a task to install the puppet agent package on a node. This task need to run as root so if you're not logging in as root with vagrant you'll need to tell bolt to sudo to root with `--run-as root`

```
bolt task run install_puppet -n node1 --run-as root
```

This task may take a while and will produce a lot of output when it's done.

# Install r10k and Puppetfile modules

Committing modules directly to the control repo is useful while developing new modules or for private modules that won't be shared. For public modules hosted either in their own repositories on the Puppet Forge it's easier to use a Puppetfile and install them with r10k. To do that first you need to install `r10k`

```
gem install r10k
```

Now you can use r10k to install the modules in the Puppetfile `~/.puppetlabs/task-modules/Puppetfile`

```
cd ~/.puppetlabs/task-modules
r10k puppetfile install ./Puppetfile
```

# Inspect installed tasks

Lets see what tasks we installed in the previous step.  

```
$ bolt task show
apache                        Allows you to perform apache service functions
apt                           Allows you to perform apt functions
bootstrap                     Bootstrap a node with puppet-agent
exec                          Executes an arbitrary shell command on the target system
facter_task                   Inspect the value of system facts
install_puppet                Install the puppet 5 agent package
minifact
mysql::sql                    Allows you to execute arbitary SQL
package                       Manage and inspect the state of packages
puppet_conf                   Inspect puppet agent configuration settings
puppet_device                 Run puppet device on a (proxy) Puppet agent
puppeteer::apply              Run a puppet apply on agents
puppeteer::certificate_info   Grab certificate information on agent
puppeteer::external_fact      Add or update external facts on agents
puppeteer::features           Query the node for what features are available
puppeteer::providers          Query the node for what providers are available
resource                      Inspect the value of resources
service                       Manage and inspect the state of services

Use `bolt task show <task-name>` to view details and parameters for a specific task.
```

# Use package task to check status of package

With Puppet installed on the node we can use some of the tasks that expose Puppet resources, like the package task which you just installed from the Puppet Forge with r10k.  We can use the bolt to show us the parameters used by the package task.  

```
$ bolt task show package
package - Manage and inspect the state of packages

USAGE:
bolt task run --nodes, -n <node-name> package action=<value> name=<value> [version=<value>] [provider=<value>]

PARAMETERS:
- action: Enum['install', 'status', 'uninstall', 'upgrade']
    The operation (install, status, uninstall and upgrade) to perform on the package
- name: String[1, default]
    The name of the package to be manipulated
- version: Optional[String[1, default]]
    Version numbers must match the full version to install, including release if the provider uses a release moniker. 
    Ranges or semver patterns are not accepted except for the gem package provider. 
    For example, to install the bash package from the rpm bash-4.1.2-29.el6.x86_64.rpm, use the string '4.1.2-29.el6'.
- provider: Optional[String[1, default]]
    The provider to use to manage or inspect the package, defaults to the system package manager
```

Let's quickly check on the status of a specific package using `bolt`:

```
$ bolt task run package action=status name=bash --nodes node1
Started on node1...
Finished on node1:
  {
    "status": "up to date",
    "version": "4.2.46-29.el7_4"
  }
Ran on 1 node in 3.81 seconds
```

# Use package task to install a package

The package task also supports other actions, including ensuring a package is installed. Let's install a package across all of our nodes using that action:

```
$ bolt task run package action=install name=vim --nodes node --run-as root
Started on node1...
Finished on node1:
  {
    "status": "present",
    "version": "2:7.4.160-2.el7"
  }
Ran on 1 node in 15.26 seconds
```
