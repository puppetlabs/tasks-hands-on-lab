# Running Existing Tasks

> **Difficulty**: Intermediate

> **Time**: Approximately 10 minutes

In this exercise you will explore some existing tasks, including several tasks that take advantage of Puppet under-the-hood.

> **Note:** Some of the following content will be available on The Forge soon.

- [Install Puppet using Bolt](#install-puppet-using-bolt)
- [Use package task to check status of package](#use-package-task-to-check-status-of-package)
- [Use package task to install a package](#use-package-task-to-install-a-package)
- [The Tasks Playground](#more-tips-tricks-and-ideas-on-the-tasks-playground)

# Prerequisites

For the following exercises you should already have `bolt` installed and have a few nodes (either Windows or Linux) available to run commands against. The following guides will help:

1. [Installing Bolt](../1-installing-bolt)
1. [Acquiring nodes](../2-acquiring-nodes)

It is also useful to have some familiarity with running commands with `bolt` so you understand passing nodes and credentials. The following exercise is recommended:

1. [Running Commands](../3-running-commands)

# Install Puppet using Bolt

[puppet-install-shell](https://github.com/petems/puppet-install-shell) is a project to maintain a set of scripts which install Puppet on a range of different Linux flavors.

The script can be downloaded and piped to `sh` as indicated in the documentation, alternatively you can download the script locally and then use `bolt script` to upload and run it.

```
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/petems/puppet-install-shell/master/install_puppet_5_agent.sh
bolt script run install_puppet_5_agent.sh --nodes <nodes>
```

That should output various installation steps and result in Puppet being installed from the official Puppet packages on the target nodes. You can verify that with bolt itself.

```
$ bolt command run "/opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet --version" --nodes <nodes>
node1:

5.2.0

Ran on 1 node in 0.68 seconds
```
# Install the package task using librarian-puppet

Tasks are packaged into Puppet modules.  You can use librarian-puppet to install modules that contain tasks, 
such as the package module.

```
gem install librarian-puppet
```

Create a Puppetfile with the following content:

```
forge "https://forgeapi.puppetlabs.com"

mod 'puppetlabs-package',
  :git => "https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-package.git"
```

We then run librarian-puppet to download the modules to the ```./modules``` folder.

```
librarian-puppet install
```

This should create a ```./modules``` folder if one doesn't already exist and download the ```package``` module.

# Use package task to check status of package

With Puppet installed on the node we can use some of the tasks that expose Puppet resources, like the package task.

The `package` task is one of a number of tasks written to accompany the launch of `bolt`. These tasks will shortly be available from the Forge, but for the moment you can find it in the repository for this lab. Let's download it from there:

```bash
mkdir -p modules/package/tasks
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/puppetlabs/tasks-hands-on-lab/master/6-downloading-and-running-existing-tasks/modules/package/tasks/init.rb
```

Or the same on Windows with PowerShell:

```powershell
mkdir modules/package/tasks
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/puppetlabs/tasks-hands-on-lab/master/6-downloading-and-running-existing-tasks/modules/package/tasks/init.rb --outfile modules/package/tasks/init.rb
```

Let's quickly check on the status of a specific package using `bolt`:

```
bolt task run package action=status package=bash --nodes <nodes> --modules ./modules
node1:

{"status":"up to date","version":"4.3-7ubuntu1.7"}

Ran on 1 node in 3.81 seconds
```

# Use package task to install a package

The package task also supports other actions, including ensuring a package is installed. Let's install a package across all of our nodes using that action:

```
bolt task run package action=install package=vim --nodes <nodes> --modules ./modules
node1:

{"status":"installed","version":"2:7.4.052-1ubuntu3.1"}

Ran on 1 node in 15.26 seconds
```

We've really only scratched the surface of Tasks in these exercises. You'll find lots more tips, tricks, examples and hacks on the [Puppet Tasks Playground](https://github.com/puppetlabs/tasks-playground).

# Next steps

Now you know how to download and run third party tasks with `bolt` you can move on to:
